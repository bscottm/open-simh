# Scott's Fork from Open SIMH machine simulator project

It's time I just went my own way with respect to [open-simh](https://github.com/open-simh/simh/). I have my own ideas on how to
improve the codebase that are at odds with one original SIMH author. Open souce is supposed to be collaborative, not constant
intellectual combat and responding to unrelated trivia. There's a point at which the noise from someone pounding the table needs to
become background noise.

## `mainpath` branch vs. `master` branch

The `mainpath` branch is where I merge all of my development. The `master` branch still exists mainly to track changes from the
open-simh project. `mainpath` is the default branch in Github.


# Open SIMH machine simulator

This is the codebase of SIMH, a framework and collection of computer system simulators.

SIMH was created by Bob Supnik, originally at Digital Equipment Corporation, and extended by contributions of many other people.  It is now an open source project, licensed under an MIT open source license (see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for the specific wording).  The project gatekeepers are the members of the [SIMH Steering Group](SIMH-SG.md).  We welcome and encourage contributions from all.  Contributions will be covered by the project license.

The Open SIMH code base was taken from a code base maintained by Mark Pizzolato as of 12 May 2022.  From that point onward there is no connection between that source and the Open SIMH code base.  A detailed listing of features as of that point may be found in [SIMH-V4-status](SIMH-V4-status.md).
